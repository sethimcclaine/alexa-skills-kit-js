/**
 * This sample shows how to create a Lambda function for handling Alexa Skill requests that:
 *
 * - Web service: communicate with an external web service to get events for specified days in history (Wikipedia API)
 * - Pagination: after obtaining a list of events, read a small subset of events and wait for user prompt to read the next subset of events by maintaining session state
 * - Dialog and Session state: Handles two models, both a one-shot ask and tell model, and a multi-turn dialog model.
 * - SSML: Using SSML tags to control how Alexa renders the text-to-speech.
 *
 * Examples:
 * One-shot model:
 * User:  "Alexa, ask History Buff what happened on August thirtieth."
 * Alexa: "For August thirtieth, in 2003, [...] . Wanna go deeper in history?"
 * User: "No."
 * Alexa: "Good bye!"
 *
 * Dialog model:
 * User:  "Alexa, open History Buff"
 * Alexa: "History Buff. What day do you want events for?"
 * User:  "August thirtieth."
 * Alexa: "For August thirtieth, in 2003, [...] . Wanna go deeper in history?"
 * User:  "Yes."
 * Alexa: "In 1995, Bosnian war [...] . Wanna go deeper in history?"
 * User: "No."
 * Alexa: "Good bye!"
